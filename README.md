## Resources

Here are some resources I used while preparing for the talk --

- [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Clearly Explained!!!](https://youtu.be/AsNTP8Kwu80?si=y95o4sGrv6IvMG53)
- [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Zero to Hero](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzDbLUZkbudP-MFQZwNmU4S&si=apzLVp9U_8nwGdh2) (A lot of content was taken from the whole series)

I'll complete this repository in sometime. So please feel free to star this repository so you can come back to it easily later.
